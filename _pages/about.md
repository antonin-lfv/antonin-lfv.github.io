Welcome to my personal website! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, having previously completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 

In addition to my studies, I serve as an administrator and moderator on [machinelearnia.com](https://machinelearnia.com), a thriving community dedicated to Data Sciences.

Beyond computing, I am passionate about astronomy and astrophotography. To showcase my astrophotography, I have built a [photo gallery website](https://antonin-lfv.github.io/PhotographyWebsite/). Electronics is another area of interest for me. Feel free to explore my website to discover my projects, accomplishments, and learn more about me.
