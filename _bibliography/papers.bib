  title={Design of a Connected and Intelligent Weather Station with ESP32 and MQTT},
  author = {Antonin L.},
  abstract = {This project aims to develop a connected and intelligent weather station. It will be equipped with various sensors: the BMP180 for measuring temperature and atmospheric pressure, the HTU21 for humidity, and a Grove sensor for assessing air quality. The data collected by these sensors will be transmitted via an ESP32 to a local MQTT server on a Mac. This server, in addition to displaying the received information using a Python script, will be capable of storing this data for visualization through a Streamlit dashboard. The weather station will provide real-time information on environmental conditions, contributing to a better understanding and prediction of local climate.},

  author = {Antonin L.},
  abstract = {This project aims to develop a real-time structural deformation monitoring system using a combination of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes. Three MPU6050 sensors are used to detect variations in acceleration and rotation (gyroscope) at three specific points on the structure. These sensors are connected to ESP32 modules that transmit the collected data to a local MQTT server. A Python script retrieves this data, processes it to estimate the deformation of the structure, and stores it in a MongoDB database for later analysis. The deformations of the structure are visualized in real-time using a 3D Bezier curve, allowing for the observation of the structure's tilt and movement. This system offers a real-time structural monitoring solution.},
